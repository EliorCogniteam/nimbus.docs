.. _nvidia-nano:
Nvidia Jetson Nano
----------------------------

- The power of modern AI is now available for makers, learners, and embedded developers everywhere.
- NVIDIA® Jetson Nano™ Developer Kit is a small, powerful computer that lets you run multiple neural networks in parallel for applications like image classification, object detection, segmentation, and speech processing. All in an easy-to-use platform that runs in as little as 5 watts.
- It’s simpler than ever to get started! Just insert a microSD card with the system image, boot the developer kit, and begin using the same NVIDIA JetPack SDK used across the entire NVIDIA Jetson™ family of products. JetPack is compatible with NVIDIA’s world-leading AI platform for training and deploying AI software, reducing complexity and effort for developers.
- Get started today with the Jetson Nano Developer Kit. We look forward to seeing what you create!
- Check out `Nvidia Jetson Nano  <https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano-developer-kit>`_
- To get started with your board follow `these instructions  <https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-nano-devkit/>`_

.. _nvidia-jetson-xavier-nx:
Nvidia Jetson Xavier
----------------------------
- NVIDIA® Jetson Xavier™ NX brings supercomputer performance to the edge in a small form factor system-on-module (SOM). Up to 21 TOPS of accelerated computing delivers the horsepower to run modern neural networks in parallel and process data from multiple high-resolution sensors—a requirement for full AI systems.

.. _nvidia-orin:
Nvidia Jetson Orin 
----------------------------
- Bring your next-gen products to life with the world’s most powerful AI computers for energy-efficient autonomous machines. 
- NVIDIA® Jetson Orin™ modules give you up to 275 trillion operations per second (TOPS) and 8X the performance of the last generation for multiple concurrent AI inference pipelines, plus high-speed interface support for multiple sensors. With seven different modules based on the same architecture–from the entry-level Jetson Orin Nano™ to the highest performance Jetson AGX Orin™– this is the ideal family for a new age of robotics.
