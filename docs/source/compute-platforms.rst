.. _nvidia-nano:
Nvidia Jetson Nano
----------------------------

- The power of modern AI is now available for makers, learners, and embedded developers everywhere.
- NVIDIA® Jetson Nano™ Developer Kit is a small, powerful computer that lets you run multiple neural networks in parallel for applications like image classification, object detection, segmentation, and speech processing. All in an easy-to-use platform that runs in as little as 5 watts.
- It’s simpler than ever to get started! Just insert a microSD card with the system image, boot the developer kit, and begin using the same NVIDIA JetPack SDK used across the entire NVIDIA Jetson™ family of products. JetPack is compatible with NVIDIA’s world-leading AI platform for training and deploying AI software, reducing complexity and effort for developers.
- Get started today with the Jetson Nano Developer Kit. We look forward to seeing what you create!
