   Cogniteam Cloud Platform is a cloud robotics platform that provides a
   unified way to **develop**, **deploy** and **manage robots** and
   **fleets**. The platform allows you to teleoperate robots, monitor &
   record sensor information from anywhere in the world with one
   customizable dashboard. You can monitor an individual robot or a
   fleet of robots, gain remote access, and display various types of
   information: data streams, performance analytics, fault diagnostics,
   and more. The simulation tool provided by Cogniteam is powerful and
   flexible, allowing you to create and run simulations of your robots
   and their behaviors, allowing you to test and evaluate new designs,
   train operators, and predict the performance of your robots under
   different conditions.

   Cogniteam Platform also offers a low-code development platform that
   makes your ROS journey intuitive using drag-and-drop tools and a rich
   set of ready-made AI algorithms such as object recognition,
   navigation, and path planning that are ROS1/2 compatible. You can
   easily design, develop, and test your robots, allowing you to create
   custom behaviors that are tailored to your unique needs. The platform
   supports ROS 1/2 by providing a bridge that allows ROS 1/2 nodes to
   communicate. This enables developers to leverage the existing ROS
   ecosystem, libraries, and tools while benefiting from the platform
   capabilities.
